        <h1> What is telemedicine? </h1>
        <p>”Telemedicine is the use of telecommunications technology to provide health care services to persons who are at some distance from the provider. It involves a spectrum of technologies (<a href=”https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193577/#b82-hcfr-17-1-115”> Perednia and Allen, 1995;</a>) (<a href=”https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193577/#b84-hcfr-17-1-115”>  Perednia and Grigsby, 1995 </a>) including facsimile, medical data transmission, audio-only format (telephone and radio), still images, and full-motion video. Robotics (<a href=”https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193577/#b69-hcfr-17-1-115”>  Minsky, 1979; </a> <a href=”https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4193577/#b97-hcfr-17-1-115”>  Satava, 1992</a>) and virtual reality interfaces (Kelly, 1994) have been introduced into some experimental applications.”</p>

        <h1>Sensors</h1>
        <p>“Biosensors and nanosensors are increasingly being utilized as clinical diagnostic tools to monitor a patient’s day-to-day activities. Cardiovascular diseases can be easily monitored with smart implants such as coronary stents and endoSure sensors.”</p>

        <h1>Relationship of doctors and patients</h1>
        <p>Effective patient-physician communication is also an important factor in patient satisfaction, self-care efficacy, and perceived health management outcomes. Patients who experience effective communication with providers report greater satisfaction, self-care efficacy, and perceived health management outcomes. Research has shown that simulated patients who either had video or FtF consultations with medical interns did not experience differences in satisfaction, perceived information exchange, interpersonal relationship building, or perceived shared decision making. Similarly, patients who received an FtF, a phone, or a video consultation reported no differences in distress levels after the consultation. </p>
         <p>Communication effectiveness is also important for self-care efficacy and health management. Patients who experience effective communication with providers (eg, feel listened to, respected, and that their provider explains things clearly) are more motivated to take care of themselves.Indeed, patients who have diabetes and effective provider communication report greater insulin adherence and glycemic control. </p>
