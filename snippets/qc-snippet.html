        <h1>Quantum computing applied in Medical Research</h1>
          <p>We may be at the advent of a revolution in computer applications in clinical care and medical research. Quantum computing can exponentially advance computational power and promises to usher in a new epoch in computing technology. Quantum computing compared to current computing could be what the first personal computer was to Charles Babbage’s 1833 primitive computer the ‘difference engine”.</p>

        <h1>AI and Quantum Computing in healthcare</h1>
          <p>The computational power to generate diagnoses in real time or to increase the precision of imaging to detect early stages of cancer may soon push beyond the limits of the standard binary 0/1 system available to Watson. Private industry (Google, IBM, etc.) and government agencies are already investing into quantum computing and artificial intelligence systems to make this happen. Thus, IBM may be one of the first to impact health care through quantum computing or artificial intelligence.</p>

        <h1>Cryptography and quantum computing in healthcare</h1>
          <p>Standard encryption methods rely on a keycode for the user to access encrypted data. However, the key must be shared and can be decoded by unauthorized persons seeking to ‘hack’ a system. With QC, the key and the data can be secured [...] with guaranteed unbreakable encryption. Such strong security is possible because quantum encryption relies on the laws of nature (quantum mechanics) to furnish it. Thus, cryptography is expected to be the first application of QC to enter medical practice to secure medical records [...].</p>

        <h1>Machine learning, database and the role of Quantum computing in healthcare</h1>
          <p>Machine learning [...] depends on growing databases containing constantly updating medical record information and linked to other sources of data (e.g. wearable technology). To deal with this complexity future ML programs will require computational power of QC to deliver results in real time. With more data informing predictive models and QC power, the clinician may be able to select a therapy perfectly suited to an individual patient based on models continuously running and updated to predict treatment response[..].</p>

        <h1>Effect of AI in quantum computing in healthcare</h1>
          <p>It is expected that a quantum MRI machine will generate extremely precise imaging allowing visualization of single molecules. Using artificial intelligence, quantum computing can be applied to interpreting diagnostic images. Not only will image detail be exponentially improved but the physician can be aided in interpreting results because efficient machine learning can train a quantum computer to identify abnormal findings with precision better than the human eye.</p>

        <h1>Quantum computing applied to treat cancer</h1>
          <p>In cancer treatment, quantum computing will contribute to improved therapies. Computers are currently used to deal with the thousands of variables used to develop a radiation plan that targets cancer cells without damaging healthy ones.Quantum computers would allow rapid and more precise radiation plans and allow comparisons between all possible approaches. The end result would be an ideal radiation dose pointed at the right target and thus lead to more effective treatment with reduced side effects.</p>

        <h1>What are the cons?</h1>
          <p>Will the future include visits to virtual physicians? Most patients expect more than a pill when they seek care. Particularly when treatment involves greater risk as in surgery and when treatment effectiveness requires patient adherence to complex regimens. QC does not replace the doctor-patient relationship, transparency and trust required in shared decision making. Nor will a computer replace the ability of a physician to offer encouragement, empathy, social support [...]. Computer algorithms, whether run on a “traditional computer” or a future quantum laptop computer, do not have feelings and will never be able to provide the impact of a surgeon’s promise to “get you through this procedure” or the reinforcing effects of a primary care provider’s encouragement to “walk just another 5 minutes” to enhance your health.</p>
