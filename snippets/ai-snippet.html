        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>”Artificial  intelligence  (AI) is  defined as  intelligence exhibited  by  an  artificial  entity  to  solve  complex problems and such a system is generally assumed to be a computer  or  machine.  Artificial Intelligence  is  an integration  of  computer  science  and  physiology Intelligence in simple language is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world.”</p>

        <h1>Neural Networks</h1>
        <p>”Artificial  neural  networks  (ANN)  have  been developed as generalizations of mathematical models of biological nervous  systems. […] An  Artificial  Neural Network  is  a  network  of  collections  of  very  simple processors  ("Neurons")  each  possibly  having  a  (small amount  of)  local  memory.  The units  operate  only  on their local data and on  the inputs  they receive  via the connections  or  links  which  are  unidirectional”</p>

        <h1>Applications</h1>
        <p>“The most  general applications  where  neural  networks  are  most  widely used for problem solving are in pattern recognition, data analysis,  control  and  clustering.  Artificial  Neural Networks  have  abundant  features  including  high processing speeds and the ability to learn the solution to a problem from a set of examples.”

        <p>Other applications are:
          <ul>
            <li>“Autonomous walker & Underwater Robot”</li>
            <li>“Facial Animation”</li>
            <li>“Data Mining or Knowledge Extraction”</li>
            <li><“Natural Language Processing”/li>
            <li>“Speech Reading (Lip reading)”</li>
          </ul>

        <h1>Trends</h1>
        <p>”Artificial intelligence in the future will try to make machines and computers  much more  sophisticated  than  the ones  that we  have  today. It  is  expected  that  in  the future,  such machines will be developed, which have basic common sense,  similar to  human  beings,  although pertaining  to specific  areas only.  It  is also  expected  that  the human mind functions, such as learning by experience, learning by  rehearsal,  cognition  and  perception  will  also  be performed by future intelligent machines.”</p>
